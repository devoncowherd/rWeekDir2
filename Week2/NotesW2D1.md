# Git

- Git Bash is a unix emulator
- Reveals what is actually happening with the file explorer 


### Navigation

- `ls` = lists the directories and files in the current folder
- `cd` = to change directory
- `cd..` = goes up one level by generated hidden folders
- `--help` = gives helps

### Folder Manipulation

- `mkdir` = makes a directory
- `rmdir` = remove the directory
- `rf` = recursively deletes an entire folder
    - **!!CAREFUL** can delete all subfolders no matter what
- `mv` moves files or folders
    - **Always be sure of the name as this can create major folder errors**
- `-r` indicates recursion
- `cp` copy dir

### File Manipulation

- `touch` creates a new files
- `cp` is used to copy a file
- `rm` removes a file

- Visual
    - How? `v`

# Java

- Write Once Run Anywhere (WORA)

### Write Once Run Anywhere

- Arithmetic Operators
    - `+` add
    - `-` subtract
    - `/` divide
    - `*` multiply
    - `--` decrement
    - `++` increment
- Assignment Operators
    - `=` sets the variable or function
    - `+=` adds and reassigns
    - `-=` subtracts and reassigns
- Comparison Operators
    - `==` compares two for equality
    - `<` less than
    - `>` greater than
    - `<=` less than or equal to
    - `=>` greater than or equal to
- Logical Operators
    - `||` or
    - `&&` and
- Bitwise Operators
    - `|` bitwise or
    - `&` bitwise and

- *override built-in methods as desired*
- *`.equals()` when comparing objects can resolve to true if their properties are identical whereas == will not*
