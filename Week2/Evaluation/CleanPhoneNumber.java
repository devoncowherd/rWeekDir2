	 * 14. Clean the Phone Number
	 * 
	 * Clean up user-entered phone numbers so that they can be sent SMS messages.
	 * 
	 * The North American Numbering Plan (NANP) is a telephone numbering system used
	 * by many countries in North America like the United States, Canada or Bermuda.
	 * All NANP-countries share the same international country code: 1.
	 * 
	 * NANP numbers are ten-digit numbers consisting of a three-digit Numbering Plan
	 * Area code, commonly known as area code, followed by a seven-digit local
	 * number. The first three digits of the local number represent the exchange
	 * code, followed by the unique four-digit number which is the subscriber
	 * number.
	 * 
	 * The format is usually represented as
	 * 
	 * 1 (NXX)-NXX-XXXX where N is any digit from 2 through 9 and X is any digit
	 * from 0 through 9.
	 * 
	 * Your task is to clean up differently formatted telephone numbers by removing
	 * punctuation and the country code (1) if present.
	 * 
	 * For example, the inputs
	 * 
	 * +1 (613)-995-0253 613-995-0253 1 613 995 0253 613.995.0253 should all produce
	 * the output
	 * 
	 * 6139950253
	 * 
	 * Note: As this exercise only deals with telephone numbers used in
	 * NANP-countries, only 1 is considered a valid country code.
