### Types of Indexes

- unique
    - indexing is a process to find an ordered list into an ordered list that allows fast retrieval of records
    - creates value for each in a given column
    - `create unique index <index_name> on <table_name>(col1,col2);`
- clustered
    - table where data for rows is stored
    - defines the order of the table data
    - can only have one clustered index
    - you may make a clustered index based on primary key
- non-clustered
