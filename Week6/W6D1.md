- Why?
    - Highly durable, scalable, efficient, and affordable

### Economies of Scale

- This is the ability to reduce costs and gain efficiency by operating at a smaller scale and off-loading to cloud providers

### Hybrid

- Combines public and private clouds for special cases such as protecting private information

### Tradeoffs

- In-house requires in-house IT
- Servers don't need to be maintained if by org if public
- Scaling is handed by public
- Public is arguably more vulnerable as security is managed by the public company

### AWS

- Instances
